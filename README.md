Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset

# what is the ‚Äúgrowth mindset‚Äù ??
 
 it is an inquiry into the power of our beliefs, both conscious and unconscious, and how changing even the simplest of them can have profound impact on nearly every aspect of our lives.
 A ‚Äúgrowth mindset‚Äù thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
 
 if i want to keep myself in a growth mindset not fixed, i have to be on the below points:
 1- i will not give up , but i will persist in the face of setbacks.
 2-i will embrace all challenges not avoid it.
 3-my efforts will be the path to my golls not fruitless.
 4-i will achieve my nots and ideas üí°.
