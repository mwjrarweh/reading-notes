# How you can benefit from a growth mindset??

The growth mindset can open **pathways** to more *creativity and possibility*, and enable the setting of higher goals and more **achievement**.

# What is a growth mindset?
A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:
