# second day of our course blog


yesterday we have learned many things in HTML but today is different ,because we learned how to use  insted of h1, so if i want to header any woeds just i will put '#' before it.
Now if i want to change the style of linne as the **bold** or *italic* by using '**' or '*' respectively.

**there are many differences between HTML and markdown:**
1. MD is more easy.
1. we can save a time using that 

Also we have learnt how to add a link of any wesite like [Google](http://google.com)
at this website you will find the serch engine which is famous and thier **logo** is below:
![Google Logo](https://pngimg.com/uploads/google/google_PNG19624.png)
