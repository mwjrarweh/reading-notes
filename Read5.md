# What is CSS?

CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.


CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets it describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
 CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once, External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

# Why Use CSS?

CSS Syntax, A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:

```
h1{
    color:blue
}
```

# The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

# The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

# Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

# Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
