# Git , lovely Git :) 

do you know what is git ? github ?? ok no worries i will let you know.

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file 
and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

Git helps edit your main project by cloning it then merging without changing the main image.

also **Git** is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers cooperating on source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.


**below you can finde some git commands and how we can use them**

1- git push to send the committed changes of master branch to your remote repository.

2- git add to add a file to the staging area.




##Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
