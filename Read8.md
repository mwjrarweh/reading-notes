# JS

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)


1. ## JavaScript Comparison and Logical Operators:

#### Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.

- ### Logical Operators:


#### Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

 Operator | Description
------------ | -------------
&& | and
|| | or
! | not

- ### Comparing Different Types:

 Operator | Description
------------ | -------------
< | Less than
> | Larger than
== | Equail (The type may not be the same)
=== | Equail (The type must be the same)
!= | Not Equail

2. ## JS for and while loops

#### Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.


see you :).
